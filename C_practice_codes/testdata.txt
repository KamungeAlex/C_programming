My name is Alex Kariuki Kamunge, a software developer at ALX.
I started this journey so that i can be able to make money from a hobby that i enjoy.
I recently graduated campus and currently I am Jobless but I do hope that things will get better in the end because I am no longer walking in my will but in the perfect will of Jesus Christ.
I dream of becoming an auther of inspirational books that will touch and transform minds of my fellow countrymen together with the whole of Africa. 
I am currently in the middle of an existensial crisis in my life wherby I am struggling with who I am and who I am ment to be.
All my life I have always looked up to things to add up in the end, but recently I have been having anxiety of life to  apoint wher I almost feel like giving up, but all in all the word of the Lord is Alive in me and Inow understand that Jesus is at the wheel of my life and everything will be okay.
I pray to one day fall in love with a beautiful dame and build a family and raise them to be great men in the coming generation. My prayer each and everyday is that God will build me so that I can be a man capable of raising a family.


EPILOGUE.

Hello. Whoever is reading this, i dont know how you came into possesion of this because it is a confidential matter, something tha I have drafted, just to practice on my flow of thoughts. Regardless, most of the things stated there are 100% true and are just 0.0001% of some of the thoughts tha have been flowing in my mind. I would love to practice writing and editing because I feel that soon it is going to be  bigger part of my life and livelihood. If I ever beome a great writer in future, I will always look back at this moment as the momemnt I started writing. Funny Enough I have titled this as an Epilogue, but I for sure have no idea what's the meaning of an Epilogue, keep in mind that this is true at the moment in time that I wa writing this. Each and everyday I wonder whether I will one day live to see myself achieve the dreams I have been dreaming lately, some seemingly very impractical, but I guess time will tell.
